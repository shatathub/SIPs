## Abstract

This SIP defines a standard set of custom errors for commonly-used tokens, which are defined as [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md), [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md), and [SRC-1155](./SIP-1155.md) tokens.

Shatat applications and wallets have historically relied on revert reason strings to display the cause of transaction errors to users. Recent Solidity versions offer rich revert reasons with error-specific decoding (sometimes called "custom errors"). This SIP defines a standard set of errors designed to give at least the same relevant information as revert reason strings, but in a structured and expected way that clients can implement decoding for.

## Motivation

Since the introduction of Solidity custom errors in v0.8.4, these have provided a way to show failures in a more expressive and gas efficient manner with dynamic arguments, while reducing deployment costs.

However, [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md), [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md), [SRC-1155](./SIP-1155.md) were already finalized when custom errors were released, so no errors are included in their specification.

Standardized errors allow users to expect more consistent error messages across applications or testing environments, while exposing pertinent arguments and overall reducing the need of writing expensive revert strings in the deployment bytecode.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The following errors were designed according to the criteria described in [Rationale](#rationale).

This SIP defines standard errors that may be used by implementations in certain scenarios but it does not specify whether implementations should revert in those scenarios, which remains up to the implementers unless a revert is mandated by the corresponding SIPs.

The names of the error arguments are defined in the [Parameter Glossary](#parameter-glossary) and MUST be used according to those definitions.

### Error additions

Any addition to this SIP or implementation-specific errors (such as extensions) SHOULD follow the guidelines presented in the [rationale](#rationale) section to keep consistency.

## Rationale

The chosen objectives for a standard for token errors are to provide context about the error, and to make moderate use of meaningful arguments (to maintain the code size benefits with respect to strings).

Considering this, the error names are designed following a basic grammatical structure based on the standard actions that can be performed on each token and the [subjects](#actions-and-subjects) involved.

### Actions and subjects

An error is defined based on the following **actions** that can be performed on a token and its involved _subjects_:

- **Transfer**: An operation in which a _sender_ moves to a _receiver_ any number of tokens (fungible _balance_ and/or non-fungible _token ids_).
- **Approval**: An operation in which an _approver_ grants any form of _approval_ to an _operator_.

These attempt to exhaustively represent what can go wrong in a token operation. Therefore, the errors can be constructed by specifying which _subject_ failed during an **action** execution, and prefixing with an [error prefix](#error-prefixes).

Note that the action is never seen as the subject of an error.

If a subject is called different on a particular token standard, the error should be consistent with the standard's naming convention.

### Error prefixes

An error prefix is added to a subject to derive a concrete error condition.
Developers can think about an error prefix as the _why_ an error happened.

A prefix can be `Invalid` for general incorrectness, or more specific like `Insufficient` for amounts.

### Domain

Each error's arguments may vary depending on the token domain. If there are errors with the same name and different arguments, the Solidity compiler currently fails with a `DeclarationError`.

An example of this is:

```solidity
InsufficientApproval(address spender, uint256 allowance, uint256 needed);
InsufficientApproval(address operator, uint256 tokenId);
```

For that reason, a domain prefix is proposed to avoid declaration clashing, which is the name of the SRC and its corresponding number appended at the beginning.

Example:

```solidity
SRC20InsufficientApproval(address spender, uint256 allowance, uint256 needed);
SRC721InsufficientApproval(address operator, uint256 tokenId);
```

### Arguments

The selection of arguments depends on the subject involved, and it should follow the order presented below:

1. _Who_ is involved with the error (eg. `address sender`)
2. _What_ failed (eg. `uint256 allowance`)
3. _Why_ it failed, expressed in additional arguments (eg. `uint256 needed`)

A particular argument may fall into overlapping categories (eg. _Who_ may also be _What_), so not all of these will be present but the order shouldn't be broken.

Some tokens may need a `tokenId`. This is suggested to include at the end as additional information instead of as a subject.

### Error grammar rules

Given the above, we can summarize the construction of error names with a grammar that errors will follow:

```
<Domain><ErrorPrefix><Subject>(<Arguments>);
```

Where:

- _Domain_: `SRC20`, `SRC721` or `SRC1155`. Although other token standards may be suggested if not considered in this SIP.
- _ErrorPrefix_: `Invalid`, `Insufficient`, or another if it's more appropriate.
- _Subject_: `Sender`, `Receiver`, `Balance`, `Approver`, `Operator`, `Approval` or another if it's more appropriate, and must make adjustments based on the domain's naming convention.
- _Arguments_: Follow the [_who_, _what_ and _why_ order](#arguments).

## Backwards Compatibility

Tokens already deployed rely mostly on revert strings and make use of `require` instead of custom errors. Even most of the newly deployed tokens since Solidity's v0.8.4 release inherit from implementations using revert strings.

This SIP can not be enforced on non-upgradeable already deployed tokens, however, these tokens generally use similar conventions with small variations such as:

- including/removing the [domain](#domain).
- using different [error prefixes](#error-prefixes).
- including similar [subjects](#actions-and-subjects).
- changing the grammar order.

Upgradeable contracts MAY be upgraded to implement this SIP.

Implementers and DApp developers that implement special support for tokens that are compliant with this SIP, SHOULD tolerate different errors emitted by non-compliant contracts, as well as classic revert strings.

## Reference Implementation

### Solidity

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

/// @title Standard SRC20 Errors
/// @dev See https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-20
///  https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-6093
interface SRC20Errors {
    error SRC20InsufficientBalance(address sender, uint256 balance, uint256 needed);
    error SRC20InvalidSender(address sender);
    error SRC20InvalidReceiver(address receiver);
    error SRC20InsufficientAllowance(address spender, uint256 allowance, uint256 needed);
    error SRC20InvalidApprover(address approver);
    error SRC20InvalidSpender(address spender);
}

/// @title Standard SRC721 Errors
/// @dev See https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-721
///  https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-6093
interface SRC721Errors {
    error SRC721InvalidOwner(address owner);
    error SRC721NonexistentToken(uint256 tokenId);
    error SRC721IncorrectOwner(address sender, uint256 tokenId, address owner);
    error SRC721InvalidSender(address sender);
    error SRC721InvalidReceiver(address receiver);
    error SRC721InsufficientApproval(address operator, uint256 tokenId);
    error SRC721InvalidApprover(address approver);
    error SRC721InvalidOperator(address operator);
}

/// @title Standard SRC1155 Errors
/// @dev See https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-1155
///  https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-6093
interface SRC1155Errors {
    error SRC1155InsufficientBalance(address sender, uint256 balance, uint256 needed, uint256 tokenId);
    error SRC1155InvalidSender(address sender);
    error SRC1155InvalidReceiver(address receiver);
    error SRC1155MissingApprovalForAll(address operator, address owner)
    error SRC1155InvalidApprover(address approver);
    error SRC1155InvalidOperator(address operator);
    error SRC1155InvalidArrayLength(uint256 idsLength, uint256 valuesLength);
}
```

## Security Considerations

There are no known signature hash collisions for the specified errors.

Tokens upgraded to implement this SIP may break assumptions in other systems relying on revert strings.

Offchain applications should be cautious when dealing with untrusted contracts that may revert using these custom errors. For instance, if a user interface prompts actions based on error decoding, malicious contracts could exploit this to encourage untrusted and potentially harmful operations.
