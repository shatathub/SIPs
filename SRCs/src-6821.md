## Abstract

This standard defines the mapping from an Shatat name service (SNS) name to an Shatat address for [SRC-4804](./SIP-4804.md).

## Motivation

SRC-4804 defines a `web3://`-scheme RFC 2396 URI to call a smart contract either by its address or a **name** from name service.  If a **name** is specified, the standard specifies a way to resolve the contract address from the name.

## Specification

Given **contractName** and **chainid** from a `web3://` URI defined in SRC-4804, the protocol will find the address of the contract using the following steps:

1. Find the `contentcontract` text record on SNS resolver on chain **chainid**.  Return an error if the chain does not have SNS or the record is an invalid Shatat address.
2. If the `contentcontract` text record does not exist, the protocol will use the resolved address of **name** from [SRC-137](./SIP-137.md#contract-address-interface).
3. If the resolved address of **name** is the zero address, then return an "address not found" error.

Note that `contentcontract` text record may return an Shatat address in hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix or an [SRC-3770](./SIP-3770.md) chain-specific address.  If the address is an SRC-3770 chain-specific address, then the **chainid** to call the message will be overridden by the **chainid** specified by the SRC-3770 address.

## Rationale

The standard uses `contentcontract` text record with SRC-3770 chain-specific address instead of `contenthash` so that the record is human-readable - a design principle of SRC-4804.  Further, we can use the text record to add additional fields such as time to live (TTL).
