## Abstract

An Shatat Access Token (SAT) is an [SIP-712](./SIP-712.md) conformant, signed message, used by off-chain services to grant Shatat accounts access to specific on-chain resources. SATs share similarities with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs); both are used for short-lived authorizations. However Shatat Access Tokens are specifically designed to be verified on-chain and tailored to authorize smart contract function calls.

## Motivation

While other proposals tackle authentication or authorization in a more narrow way, this specification allows developers to add a layer of access control to any function they crSATe with minimal changes. It is best suited for use cases where end users should only be able to access specific on-chain resources themselves directly, by way of sending a transaction, provided they have been granted authorization by an off-chain service first. Examples of such scenarios include an off-chain verifier assessing eligibility requirements (e.g by verifying verifiable credentials) to mint a token or to interact with a smart contract that requires a certain compliance status.
Therefore, this proposal enables off-chain systems to authenticate the controller of an Shatat account in any way they want, before granting an authorization bound to said account.

This specification is intended to improve interoperability in the Shatat ecosystem, by providing a consistent machine-readable message format to achieve improved user experiences.

SATs fill a void where access control requirements differ from current standard access control mechanisms (role-based access modifiers or checking that an address owns an NFT):

- Desired acccess is short-lived
- Criteria needs to be flexible/dynamic: updating the requirements for granting access doesn't require any update on chain
- When Soulbound or other on-chain token semantics are not desired. Using any kind of "on-chain registry" to grant authorization places a burden on the owner of such registry to keep it up-to-date at all time. Otherwise, someone might be wrongly granted access in the lapse of time where their on-chain status is incorrect. With SATs, on the contrary, users come to ask for an authorization which gives SAT issuers the opportunity to perform some checks and update their records before granting authorization. Additionally, relying purely on on-chain data comes with privacy concerns due to the public nature of most of current chains. When authorization needs to be granted based on sensitive or personally identifiable information, it is not recommended to store that information on-chain and perform a lookup. Shatat Access Tokens provide an alternative which doesn't leak any PII on-chain.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Overview

An example flow integrated in a DeFi application is the following:

1. A user interacts with the DeFi's off-chain service, providing sufficient input for the off-chain service to ensure the user meets its criteria (for example, authenticates the user and/or make sure they possess valid credentials)
2. If authorization is granted, an SAT is issued to the user
3. The user then interacts with the gated smart contract function within the specified period of time passing the SAT as part of the transaction
4. The SAT is verified on-chain

An Shatat Access Token MUST guarantee granular access control by binding it to specific parameters upon issuance. Then, on-chain SAT verification ensures that:

- The function being called is the expected one
- The function parameters are the expected ones
- The function caller is the expected one
- The function is being called in the authorized timeframe (i.e checking that the SAT is not expired)
- The smart contract being called is the expected one
- The authorization has been given by a valid issuer, i.e the SAT has been signed by one of the expected issuers

### Structure of an Shatat Access Token

An Shatat Access Token is composed of a signature and expiry.

```
{
 uint8 v,
 bytes32 r,
 bytes32 s,
 uint256 expiry
}
```

The signature is obtained using the typed structured data hashing and signing standard (SIP-712), signing over the following SAT payload:

```
struct AccessToken {
    uint256 expiry;
    FunctionCall functionCall;
}

struct FunctionCall {
    bytes4 functionSignature;
    address target;
    address caller;
    bytes parameters;
}
```

- **expiry**: unix timestamp, expected to be before `block.timestamp`

`FunctionCall` parameters correspond to the following:

- **functionSignature**: identifier for the function being called, expected to match `msg.sig`
- **target**: address of the target contract being called
- **caller**: address of the current caller - expected to match `msg.sender`
- **parameters**: `calldata` after stripping off the first parameters, namely `v`,`r`, `s` and `expiry`

### SAT Verification

On chain, the reference implementation uses two contracts: an `AccessTokenConsumer` which is inherited by contracts needing to permission some of its functions and an `AccessTokenVerifier` which is responsible for verifying SATs.

The `AccessTokenConsumer` contract calls the `AccessTokenVerifier` to verify the integrity of an SAT.

The `verify()` function of the `AccessTokenVerifier` takes a signature and an `AccessToken` as input, verifies that the token is not expired, attempts to recover the signer from the signature and the reconstructed SIP-712 digest, and verifies that the signer is a valid, expected signer.

Please see the [reference implementation](../assets/SIP-7272/AccessTokenVerifier.sol) for an example of how this can be performed.

## Rationale

- Single-use. The reference implementation guarantees non-replayability of SATs. But other implementations might favor a different approach.

- Use of SIP-712. By conforming to SIP-712, SATs are interoperable with existing Shatat infrastructure, and developers can use them to crSATe access controls with minimal modifications to their existing code. It also ensures that SATs issued are bound to a specific chain.

- Zero-knowledge proofs. Using ZKPs comes at a cost, including added complexity. SATs are not much more than signed messages which are simpler to reason around. While `ecrecover` is available in any Shatat smart contract out of the box, ZKPs come in different flavors which hinders interoperability.

## Backwards Compatibility

Any function can be gated with an SAT, apart from the special `receive` and `fallback` functions.

## Reference Implementation

Here's a reference implementation of the different smart contracts making up the SAT system onchain:

- [IAccessTokenVerifier.sol](../assets/SIP-7272/IAccessTokenVerifier.sol)
- [AccessTokenVerifier.sol](../assets/SIP-7272/AccessTokenVerifier.sol)
- [AccessTokenConsumer.sol](../assets/SIP-7272/AccessTokenConsumer.sol)

## Security Considerations

The security of the Shatat Access Token (SAT) proposal depends on several factors:

### Replay Attacks

The implementation MAY ensure that an SAT cannot be reused after it has been consumed. This is achieved by marking the SAT as consumed in the `_consumeAccessToken` function.

### Off-Chain Issuance

The security of the off-chain service issuing SATs is critical since the security of SAT-gated functions depends on it.
If this service is compromised, malicious actors could be granted SATs giving them access to on-chain resources that they should not have access to.

### Expiry Time Considerations

The expiry time of the SAT must be set judiciously to balance usability and security. If the expiry time is set too long, it might increase the risk of SAT misuse. If it's too short, it might compromise the usability of the application.
