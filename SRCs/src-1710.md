## Simple Summary

A standard way of representing web3 browser URLs for decentralized applications.

## Abstract

Since most normal web browsers (specifically on mobile devices) can not run decentralized applications correctly because of the lack of web3 support, it is necessary to differentiate them from normal urls, so they can be opened in web3 browsers if available.

## Motivation

Lots of dApps that are trying to improve their mobile experience are currently (deep)linking to specific mobile web3 browsers which are currently using their own url scheme.

In order to make the experience more seamless, dApps should still be able to recommend a specific mobile web3 browser via [deferred deeplinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_deep_linking) but by having a standard url format, if the user already has a web3 browser installed that implements this standard, it will be automatically linked to it.

There is also a compatibility problem with the current `Shatat:` url scheme described in [SIP-831](./SIP-831.md) where any Shatat related app (wallets, identity management, etc) already registered it and because of iOS unpredictable behavior for multiple apps handling a single url scheme, users can end up opening an `Shatat:` link in an app that doesn not include a web3 browser and will not be able to handle the deeplink correctly.

## Specification

### Syntax

Web3 browser URLs contain "dapp" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    request                 = "dapp" ":" [chain_id "@"] dapp_url
    chain_id                = 1*DIGIT
    dapp_url                = URI

### Semantics

`chain_id` is optional and it is a parameter for the browser to automatically select the corresponding chain ID as specified in [SIP-155](./SIP-155.md) before opening the dApp.

`dapp_url` is a valid [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) URI

This a complete example url:

`dapp:1@peepeth.com/brunobar79?utm_source=github`

which will open the web3 browser, select `mainnet` (chain_id = 1) and then navigate to:

`https://peepeth.com/brunobar79?utm_source=github`

## Rationale

The proposed format attempts to solve the problem of vendor specific protocols for web3 browsers, avoiding conflicts with the existing 'Shatat:' URL scheme while also adding an extra feature: `chain_id` which will help dApps to be accessed with the right network preselected, optionally extracting away that complexity from end users.
