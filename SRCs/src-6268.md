## Abstract

This SIP standardizes an interface indicating [SIP-1155](./SIP-1155.md)-compatible token non-transferability using [SIP-165](./SIP-165.md) feature detection.

## Motivation

Soulbound Tokens (SBT) are non-transferable tokens. While [SIP-5192](./SIP-5192.md) standardizes non-fungible SBTs, a standard for Soulbound semi-fungible or fungible tokens does not yet exist. The introduction of a standard non-transferability indicator that is agnostic to fungibility promotes the usage of Souldbound semi-fungible or fungible tokens.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST comform to the [SIP-1155](./SIP-1155.md) specification.

Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement all of the functions in the `ISRC6268` interface.

Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement the [SIP-165](./SIP-165.md) supportsInterface function and MUST return the constant value true if `0xd87116f3` is passed through the interfaceID argument.

For the token identifier `_id` that is marked as `locked`, `locked(_id)` MUST return the constant value true and any functions that try transferring the token, including `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` function MUST throw.
