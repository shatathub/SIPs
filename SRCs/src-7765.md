## Abstract

This SIP defines an interface to carry a real world asset with some privileges that can be exSRCised by the holder of the corresponding NFT. The SIP standardizes the interface for non-fungible tokens representing real world assets with privileges to be exSRCised, such as products sold onchain which can be redeemed in the real world.

And the privileges we describe here specifically refer to the rights and interests bound to the RWA NFT that can be executed by the holder in the real world.

## Motivation

NFTs bound to real-world assets sometimes need to carry certain privileges that can be exSRCised by the holder. Users can initiate transactions onchain to specify the exSRCise of a certain privilege, thereby achieving real-world privileges that directly map the onchain privilege through subsequent operations. For example, if a certain product such as a pair of shoes is sold onchain in the representation of NFT, the NFT holder can exSRCise the privilege of exchanging physical shoes offchain, to achieve the purpose of interoperability between the blockchain and the real world.

Having a standard interface enables interoperability for services, clients, UI, and inter-contract functionalities on top of this use-case.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

This standard inherits the [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md) NFT token standard for all transfer and approval logic. All transfer and approval functions are inherited from this token standard without changes. Additionally, this standard also inherits the SRC-721 Metadata standards for name, symbol, and metadata URI lookup.

Any compliant contract following this SIP **MUST** implement the following interface:

```
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// @title SRC-7765 Privileged Non-Fungible Tokens Tied To Real World Assets
/// @dev See https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-7765
interface ISRC7765 /* is ISRC721, ISRC165 */ {

    /// @notice This event emitted when a specific privilege of a token is successfully exSRCised.
    /// @param _operator  the address who exSRCised the privilege.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    event PrivilegeExSRCised(
        address indexed _operator,
        address indexed _to,
        uint256 indexed _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    );

    /// @notice This function exSRCise a specific privilege of a token.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    /// @param _data  extra data passed in for extra message or future extension.
    function exSRCisePrivilege(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external;

    /// @notice This function is to check whether a specific privilege of a token can be exSRCised.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    function isExSRCisable(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    ) external view returns (bool _exSRCisable);

    /// @notice This function is to check whether a specific privilege of a token has been exSRCised.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId.
    /// @param _to  the address to benefit from the privilege.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    /// @param _privilegeId  the ID of the privileges.
    function isExSRCised(
        address _to,
        uint256 _tokenId,
        uint256 _privilegeId
    ) external view returns (bool _exSRCised);

    /// @notice This function is to list all privilegeIds of a token.
    /// @param _tokenId  the NFT tokenID.
    function getPrivilegeIds(
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external view returns (uint256[] memory privilegeIds);

}
```

The function `exSRCisePrivilege` performs the exSRCise action to a specific privilege of a token. If succeeds, it is expected to emit a `PrivilegeExSRCised` event.

The function `getPrivilegeIds` provides a way to manage the binding relationship between NFTs and privilegeIds.

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for [SIP-7765](./SIP-7765.md) smart contracts. This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its details about the privileges which your NFTs carry.

```
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

/// @title SRC-7765 Privileged Non-Fungible Tokens Tied To Real World Assets, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://SIPs.Shatat.org/SIPS/SIP-7765
interface ISRC7765Metadata /* is ISRC7765 */ {

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given privilegeId.
    /// @dev Throws if `_privilegeId` is not a valid privilegeId. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "SRC-7765
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function privilegeURI(uint256 _privilegeId) external view returns (string memory);

}
```

This is the “SIP-7765 Metadata JSON Schema” referenced above.

```
{
    "title": "Privilege Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Identifies the specific privilege."
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the specific privilege."
        },
        "resource": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource representing the specific privilege."
        }
    }
}
```

`ISRC7765Metadata` provides specifications for obtaining metadata information of privileges. A contract that implements `ISRC7765Metadata` **SHALL** also implement `ISRC7765`.

## Rationale

1.  With the `PrivilegeExSRCised` event emitted onchain, we can determine that the user has confirmed the exSRCise of this privilege, so as to implement the privilege in the real world.

2. We choose to include an address `_to` for functions `exSRCisePrivilege`, `isExSRCisable` and `isExSRCised` so that a specific privilege of an NFT MAY be exSRCised for someone who will benefit from it other than the NFT holder nor the transaction initiator. And This SIP doesn't assume who has the power to perform this action, it's totally decided by the developers who are using this standard.

3. We choose to include an extra `_data` field to function `exSRCisePrivilege` for extra message or future extension. For example, developers can use `_data` to exSRCise a privilege that takes effect directly onchain such as direct distribution of cryptocurrency assets.

4. The boolean view functions of `isExSRCisable` and `isExSRCised` can be used to check whether a specific privilege of an NFT can be exSRCisable or has been exSRCised to the `_to` address.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is an extension of SRC-721. It is fully compatible with both of the commonly used optional extensions (`ISRC721Metadata` and `ISRC721Enumerable`) mentioned in the SRC-721 standard.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of Privileged NFTs can be found [Here](../assets/SIP-7765/contracts/SRC7765Example.sol).

## Security Considerations

Compliant contracts should pay attention to the storage to the states of the privileges. The contract should properly handle the state transition of each privilege of each NFT, clearly showing that each privilege is exSRCisable or has been exSRCised.

Compliant contracts should also carefully define access control, particularly whether any EOA or contract account may or may not call `exSRCisePrivilege` function in any use case. Security audits and tests should be used to verify that the access control to the `exSRCisePrivilege` function behaves as expected.
