## Abstract

This specification explains a tokenized reserve mechanism standard. Current smart contracts record transactions and are made public. The reserve will implement added functionality allowing stakeholders proactively to audit a contract. Using [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md), stakeholders can create shares to show support for actions in the contract.

## Motivation

Tokenized vaults store [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) tokens that are represented by shares within vault contracts. Implementations can follow the [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md) standard to provide basic functionality for depositing, withdrawing, and reading balances for a vault. As tokenization becomes increasingly popular, applications should use a form of tokenized vaults to store assets and allow all parties to track performance. 

This specification introduces a standard for an on-chain reserve that uses tokenized vaults to represent reserve stakeholders. Core functionality, which is an extension of [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md), will provide stakeholders representation by depositing and withdrawing from the vault. The record of transactions for other [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) assets should be easily accessible to any party for auditing.

In a tokenized reserve, stakeholders are represented by minting shares from the vault. The goal is to create a reserve similar to a real-world reserve fund used as a contingency for an entity. In most cases, an entity would follow criteria like running low on regular funds, to utilize the reserve fund. In a decentralized environment, an entity should incorporate stakeholders as criteria. Assets associated with the reserve as well as its origin will vary in decentralized environments, so transparent auditing is needed.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions:

	- owner: The creator of the reserve
	- user: Stakeholders participating in policies
	- reserve: The assets held on the contract other than underlying token
	- policies: Created by reserve owners to encourage stakeholder participation
 
### Constructor:
 
 	- name: SRC-20 token name
  	- ticker: SRC-20 ticker
   	- asset: SRC-4626 underlying SRC-20 address
	- rAuth: Authorized user, for cases utilizing more than one owner/ limiting owner withdrawals
	- rOwner: Owner of the Reserve

## Rationale

This proposed standard is designed to be a core implementation of a tokenized reserve interface. Other non-specified conditions should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Each reserve uses [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) standard for shares, and [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md) for the creation of shares. The reserve token SHOULD be considered as either the underlying `asset` for the [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md) vault or the shares that are created when depositing to the vault. 
[SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md) is used to create a transparent creation of stakeholders of the reserve. There MUST be a representation of interested parties in the reserve. The implementer can decide how to treat representation based on users entering and leaving the vault. For example, a user could be forced not to use the same tokens in multiple policies to allow shares to be distributed fairly.  

## Backwards Compatibility

Tokenized reserves are made compatible with [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) and [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md).

## Security Considerations

Tokenized reserves share the same security considerations as [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) and [SRC-4626](./SIP-4626.md).

1. Assests withdrawn by owner are not secured by vaults.
- Stakeholders SHOULD be aware that the underlying `asset` can be withdrawn by the owner with no restrictions or authorizing party, like requiring an `rAuth`. Depending on the authorizing implementation, `asset` may still be withdrawn by the owner.

A RECOMMENDED implementation:
- The `openPolicy` MUST explictly restrict the transfer of the underlying `asset`.
- If the underlying asset is apart of the reserve and not the vault,
the reserve MUST provide a mShatatod to avoid user `asset` loss.
