## Abstract

This SRC standardizes an existing mechanism to fetch token supply data from [SRC-1155](./SIP-1155.md) tokens. It adds a `totalSupply` function, which fetches the number of tokens with a given `id`, and an `exists` function, which checks for the existence of a given `id`.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
interface SRC1155Supply is SRC1155 {
  // @notice      This function MUST return whether the given token id exists, previously existed, or may exist
  // @param   id  The token id of which to check the existence
  // @return      Whether the given token id exists, previously existed, or may exist
  function exists(uint256 id) external view returns (bool);

  // @notice      This function MUST return the number of tokens with a given id. If the token id does not exist, it MUST return 0.
  // @param   id  The token id of which fetch the total supply
  // @return      The total supply of the given token id
  function totalSupply(uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

Implementations MAY support [SRC-165](./SIP-165.md) interface discovery, but consumers MUST NOT rely on it.

## Rationale

This SRC does not implement [SRC-165](./SIP-165.md), as this interface is simple enough that the extra complexity is unnecessary and would cause incompatibilities with pre-existing implementations.

The `totalSupply` and `exists` functions were modeled after [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md) and [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md).

`totalSupply` does not revert if the token ID does not exist, since contracts that care about that case should use `exists` instead (which might return false even if `totalSupply` is zero).

`exists` is included to differentiate between the two ways that `totalSupply` could equal zero (either no tokens with the given ID have been minted yet, or no tokens with the given ID will ever be minted).

## Backwards Compatibility

This SRC is designed to be backward compatible with the OpenZeppelin `SRC1155Supply`.

## Security Considerations

None.
