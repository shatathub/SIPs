## Abstract

This proposal introduces a smart contract wallet-based approach for managing NFTs, focusing on utilizing the programmable features of smart contract wallets for NFT asset management. Additionally, it introduces functions such as `nftApprove`, `nftSetApprovalForOneAll`, `nftSetApprovalForAllAll`, `nftGetApproved`, `nftIsApprovedForOneAll`, `nftIsApprovedForAllAll` and `nftTransfer`, which provide enhanced control over NFT transactions. This approach seeks to enhance NFT management by utilizing the built-in features of smart contract wallets, thus offering a more adaptable, secure, and efficient mShatatod for managing token transactions.


## Motivation

An externally-owned account (EOA) wallet has no state and code storage, while the smart contract wallet does.

Account abstraction (AA) is a direction of the smart contract wallet, which works around abstract accounts. This SRC can also be an extension based on [SRC-4337](./SIP-4337) or as a plug-in for wallets.

The smart contract wallet allows the user's own account to have state and code, bringing programmability to the wallet. We think there are more directions to expand. For example, nft asset management, functional expansion of nft transactions, etc.

The smart contract wallet interface of this SRC is for nft asset management and nft asset approval. It supports the simplenft <!-- TODO --> SRC-X, and [SRC-721](./SIP-721) is backward compatible with <!-- TODO --> SRC-X, so it can be compatible with the management of all nfts in the existing market.

The proposal aims to achieve the following goals:

1. NFT assets are allocated and managed by the wallet itself, such as approve function, which are configured by the user’s contract wallet, rather than controlled by the nft asset contract, to avoid some existing SRC-721 contract risks.
2. Add the `nftTransfer` function, the transaction initiated by the non-smart wallet itself.
3. Add `nftApprove`, `nftSetApprovalForOneAll`, `nftSetApprovalForAllAll`, `nftGetApproved`, `nftIsApprovedForOneAll`, `nftIsApprovedForAllAll` functions. The user wallet itself supports approve and provides approve. for One nft, all nft of one nft smart contract, all nft assets.
4. User wallet can choose batch approve and batch transfer.
5. Users can choose to add hook function before and after their `nftTransfer` to increase the user's more playability.
6. The user can choose to implement the `nftReceive` function.

## Rationale

the key technical decisions in this proposal are:

**Improved Approve Mechanism**
- **Current vs. Proposed**: In the existing SRC-721 system, an externally-owned account (EOA) directly interacts with nft contracts to `approve`. The new `nftApprove`, `nftSetApprovalForOneAll`, `nftSetApprovalForAllAll`, `nftGetApproved`, `nftIsApprovedForOneAll`, `nftIsApprovedForAllAll`functions in this proposed enable more precise control over nft usage within a wallet contract, a significant improvement over the traditional mShatatod.
- **Enhanced Security**: This mechanism mitigates risks like nft over-approval by shifting approval control to the user's smart contract wallet.
- **Programmability**: Users gain the ability to set advanced approval strategies, such as conditional or time-limited approvals, the `nftSetApprovalForAllAll` function specifically allows for a universal setting  all nfts. these were not possible with traditional SRC-721 nfts.

**Optimized Transfer Process**
- **Efficiency and Security**: The `nftTransfer` function streamlines the nft transfer process, making transactions both more efficient and secure.
- **Flexibility**: Allows the integration of custom logic (hooks) before and after transfers, enabling additional security checks or specific actions tailored to the user’s needs.

**Support for Batch Operations**
- **Increased Efficiency**: Users can simultaneously handle multiple `approve` or `transfer` operations, significantly boosting transaction efficiency.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Simplifies the management of numerous assets, improving the overall experience for users with large portfolios.


## Backwards Compatibility

This SRC can be used as an extension of [SRC-4337](./SIP-4337.md) and is backward compatible with SRC-4337.
