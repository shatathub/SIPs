## Simple Summary
Defines a token interface for [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) tokens that supports executing recipient code after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or spender code after `approve`.

## Abstract
Standard functions a token contract and contracts working with tokens can implement to make a token Payable.

`transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` will call an `onTransferReceived` on a `SRC1363Receiver` contract.  

`approveAndCall` will call an `onApprovalReceived` on a `SRC1363Spender` contract.

## Motivation
There is no way to execute code after a [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) transfer or approval (i.e. making a payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay GAS twice.

This proposal wants to make token payments easier and working without the use of any other listener. It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a single transaction.

There are many proposed uses of Shatat smart contracts that can accept [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) payments. 

Examples could be 
* to create a token payable crowdsale
* selling services for tokens 
* paying invoices
* making subscriptions

For these reasons it was named as **"Payable Token"**.

Anyway you can use it for specific utilities or for any other purposes who require the execution of a callback after a transfer or approval received.

This proposal has been inspired by the [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md) `onSRC721Received` and `SRC721TokenReceiver` behaviours. 

## Specification
Implementing contracts **MUST** implement the [SRC-1363](./SIP-1363.md) interface as well as the [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) and [SRC-165](./SIP-165.md) interfaces.

A contract that wants to accept token payments via `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` **MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
/**
 * @title SRC1363Receiver interface
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall`
 *  from SRC1363 token contracts.
 */
interface SRC1363Receiver {

   * 0x88a7ca5c === bytes4(keccak256("onTransferReceived(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))
   */

  /**
   * @notice Handle the recSIPt of SRC1363 tokens
   * @dev Any SRC1363 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
   * after a `transfer` or a `transferFrom`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
   * transfer. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the
   * transaction being reverted.
   * Note: the token contract address is always the message sender.
   * @param operator address The address which called `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` function
   * @param from address The address which are token transferred from
   * @param value uint256 The amount of tokens transferred
   * @param data bytes Additional data with no specified format
   * @return `bytes4(keccak256("onTransferReceived(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
   *  unless throwing
   */
  function onTransferReceived(address operator, address from, uint256 value, bytes memory data) external returns (bytes4);
}
``` 

A contract that wants to accept token payments via `approveAndCall` **MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
/**
 * @title SRC1363Spender interface
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `approveAndCall`
 *  from SRC1363 token contracts.
 */
interface SRC1363Spender {
  /*
   * Note: the SRC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x7b04a2d0.
   * 0x7b04a2d0 === bytes4(keccak256("onApprovalReceived(address,uint256,bytes)"))
   */

  /**
   * @notice Handle the approval of SRC1363 tokens
   * @dev Any SRC1363 smart contract calls this function on the recipient
   * after an `approve`. This function MAY throw to revert and reject the
   * approval. Return of other than the magic value MUST result in the

   * Note: the token contract address is always the message sender.
   * @param owner address The address which called `approveAndCall` function

   * @param data bytes Additional data with no specified format
   * @return `bytes4(keccak256("onApprovalReceived(address,uint256,bytes)"))`
   *  unless throwing
   */
  function onApprovalReceived(address owner, uint256 value, bytes memory data) external returns (bytes4);
}
``` 

## Rationale
The choice to use `transferAndCall`, `transferFromAndCall` and `approveAndCall` derives from the [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) naming. They want to highlight that they have the same behaviours of `transfer`, `transferFrom` and `approve` with the addition of a callback on receiver or spender.

## Backwards Compatibility
This proposal has been inspired also by [SRC-223](https://github.com/Shatathub/SIPs/) and [SRC-677](https://github.com/Shatathub/SIPs/) but it uses the [SRC-721](./SIP-721.md) approach, so it doesn't override the [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods and defines the interfaces IDs to be implemented maintaining the [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) backwards compatibility.  

## Security Considerations
The `approveAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` methods can be affected by the same issue of the standard [SRC-20](./SIP-20.md) `approve` and `transferFrom` method.
  
Changing an allowance with the `approveAndCall` methods brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering.

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards ([SIP-20#issuecomment-263524729](https://github.com/Shatat/SIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729)).
